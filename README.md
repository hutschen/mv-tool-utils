# MV-Tool Import Helper

Importing complex data into MV-Tool can sometimes exceed the capabilities of MV-Tool's import functions. This import helper is a Python library that allows you to import data from CSV files into MV-Tool. The data can be extracted from the CSV files, analyzed, and then transferred to MV-Tool via MV-Tool's web API. This import helper is a Python library that relies solely on the Python standard library, so it can be used without installing any Python packages and is suitable for use in environments where installing Python packages is not straightforward (e.g. in corporate networks where software installation is restricted).
